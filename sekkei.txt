基本設計 (Basic Design)
1. Project Objective
Description: 
The goal of this project is to extract Japanese text from images, translate it into English, 
and then replace the original text with the translated text while preserving the layout and design of the image.

2. Functional Requirements
Text Extraction:
Use EasyOCR to extract Japanese and English text from images.

Translation:
Use the Google Translate API to translate the extracted text from Japanese to English.
Image Modification:

Remove the Japanese text from the original image.
Add the translated text while maintaining the appropriate position and size.

User Interface:
Allow the user to upload images and display the result after translation.

3. System Architecture
Main Components:
Text Extraction Module:

Input: Image with Japanese text.
Output: Japanese and English text, with position coordinates.
Translation Module:

Input: Japanese text.
Output: English text.
Image Processing Module:
